The EmployeeProcessor application demonstrates the effective use of Java's Stream API and the Function interface for efficient data processing and manipulation. This application processes a dataset of employees to perform various operations such as concatenating employee names and departments, calculating the average salary, and filtering employees by age.

Imports

	Imported the Java classes Arrays, List, Function, and Collectors from the java.util and java.util.function packages. The Arrays class is used to create a list of employees, the List interface is used to store the collection of employees, the Function interface is used to define a lambda expression for data transformation, and the Collectors class is used to collect the results of stream operations.

Employee Class

	Defined the Employee class to encapsulate the attributes of an employee. This class includes fields for the name, age, department, and salary of an employee. It provides a constructor for initializing these fields and getter methods for accessing their values.

Main Method

	The main method is defined within the EmployeeProcessor class, which is the entry point for the program's execution. Inside the main method:

	•	A list of Employee objects is initialized using the Arrays.asList method. Each Employee object is created using the new Employee(...) constructor, with values for name, age, department, and salary.

Function Interface

	•	A Function interface is defined to concatenate the name and department of an employee. The lambda expression (Employee e) -> e.getName() + " - " + e.getDepartment() implements the Function interface, representing a function that takes an Employee object as input and returns a concatenated string as output.

	•	The Function interface in Java is a functional interface that represents a function which accepts one argument and produces a result. It is a key part of the java.util.function package and is commonly used in stream operations for data transformation. The Function interface is annotated with @FunctionalInterface, ensuring it contains only one abstract method, apply(T t).

Stream Operations

	•	A stream is created from the list of employees using the stream() method.

	•	The map(nameAndDept) method is used to apply the Function interface to each element in the stream, transforming each Employee object into a concatenated string of name and department.

	•	The collect(Collectors.toList()) method is used to collect the transformed elements into a new list, nameDeptList.

	•	The average salary of all employees is calculated using the mapToDouble(Employee::getSalary).average() method, which maps each Employee to their salary and computes the average.

	•	Employees older than a specified age threshold are filtered using the filter(e -> e.getAge() > 30) method and collected into a new list.

Summary

	The EmployeeProcessor program showcases the power and flexibility of Java streams and the Function interface for performing complex data manipulations concisely and efficiently. By using streams, the program demonstrates a modern approach to handling collections in Java, making the code more readable and maintainable. The Function interface plays a crucial role in defining lambda expressions for data transformations, highlighting how it represents a function that takes an input and produces an output.
